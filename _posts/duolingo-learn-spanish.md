## Duolingo is a great habit builder
Learning a new language is a complex journey. No matter how impressive it may sound to newbies to suddenly hear some exotic Spanish words. But the ability to speak comprehensive statements in a foreign language is tough.

Duolingo is one fun tool to kick off your language learning. It offers many advantages:

### Learning lessons on your own time. 
You don't have to create a fixed time slot in your day to learn Spanish. You can start learning in the least expected places. Be it in the toilet or public transport.

### Small modular lessons. 
Even though you can learn as much as you want within a day, Duolingo offers small incremental lessons. Hence even 5 minutes a day can allow you to finish one.
