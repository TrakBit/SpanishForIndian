## Duolingo is a great habit builder
Learning a new language is a complex journey. No matter how impressive it may sound to newbies to suddenly hear some exotic Spanish words. But the ability to speak comprehensive statements in a foreign language is challenging.

Duolingo is one fun tool to kick off your language learning. It offers many advantages:

### Learning lessons on your own time. 
You don't have to create a fixed time slot in your day to learn Spanish. You can start learning in the least expected places. Be it in the toilet or on public transport.

### Small modular lessons. 
Even though you can learn as much as you want within a day, Duolingo offers small incremental lessons. Hence even 5 minutes a day can allow you to finish one. This low-friction onboarding facilitates not giving up daily learning on a busy day. Also, don't assume that a small module here means sacrificing the learning experience. Despite small modules, it tests speaking, listening, and writing ability.

### Gamification with attainable goals
Duolingo offers challenges like a daily streak that rewards you for doing at least one lesson daily. Such simple yet effective gamification forces daily learning but doesn't feel stressful to keep up. Also, on certain days if you're in more aggressive learning mode, you can take extra challenges from Duolingo, which will help you jump up the rank in the leaderboard.
